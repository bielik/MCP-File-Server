## Current Example: MCP File Server Initial Implementation

**Created:** 2025-08-31  
**Status:** Planning  
**Priority:** High  

### Objective
Implement a production-ready MCP File Server that enables secure file operations for AI agents through the Model Context Protocol.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] MCP protocol compliance verified through official test suite
- [ ] Secure file operations with proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Performance benchmarks: 100+ concurrent connections, <100ms response time
- [ ] Complete documentation and deployment guides

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Initialize Node.js/TypeScript project with MCP SDK
- [ ] Set up development environment (linting, testing, building)
- [ ] Implement basic MCP server scaffold with connection handling
- [ ] Create configuration management system
- [ ] Set up logging and error handling framework

### Phase 2: Core File Operations (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement secure path validation and sanitization
- [ ] Create file read/write operations with streaming support
- [ ] Add directory listing and traversal functionality
- [ ] Implement file search capabilities
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for file operations

### Phase 3: Security & Protocol (Week 3)
- [ ] Implement JWT-based authentication system
- [ ] Add role-based authorization with file/directory permissions
- [ ] Complete MCP protocol implementation with all message types
- [ ] Add rate limiting and abuse prevention
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)
- [ ] Complete unit test suite with >90% coverage
- [ ] Integration testing with MCP test suite
- [ ] Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
- [ ] Production deployment configuration and documentation

### Key Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| MCP protocol complexity | Medium | High | Start with core protocol, iterate |
| File system security | High | Critical | Security-first design, extensive testing |
| Performance with large files | Medium | Medium | Streaming implementation, benchmarking |
