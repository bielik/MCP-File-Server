    "question": "What causes earthquakes?",
    "contexts": [
      "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden movement of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust.",
      "The Earth's crust is made up of several large plates that move slowly over time.",
      "When these plates get stuck and then suddenly slip, they release energy in the form of seismic waves."
    ],
    "answer": "Earthquakes are caused by the sudden movement and slipping of tectonic plates in the Earth's crust, which releases energy as seismic waves.",
    "ground_truth": "Earthquakes result from sudden movement of tectonic plates releasing seismic energy."

    "question": "How do vaccines work?",
    "contexts": [
      "Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize and fight specific diseases.",
      "They contain weakened or dead parts of the disease-causing organism or blueprints for making such parts.",
      "When vaccinated, the immune system produces antibodies and remembers how to fight the disease in the future."
    ],
    "answer": "Vaccines train the immune system by exposing it to weakened disease parts, causing the body to produce antibodies and develop immunity for future protection.",
    "ground_truth": "Vaccines stimulate immune response by introducing weakened pathogens, creating antibodies and immunological memory."
