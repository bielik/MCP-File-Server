# MCP File Server - Change Log & Decision History

**Purpose:** This log tracks significant changes, architectural decisions, and their rationale. Unlike git commits, this focuses on the "why" behind changes and provides context for future development decisions.

**Format:** Each entry should include Date, Change Type, Description, Rationale, and Impact.

### [INIT] Project Initialization and Foundational Setup
**Type:** Architecture  
**Change:** Established initial project structure and documentation framework  
**Rationale:** 
- Created comprehensive cloudmd system for maintaining rich context throughout development
- Chose MCP File Server focus based on directory name and current ecosystem needs
- Implemented structured documentation approach to reduce cognitive load in future AI interactions

**Impact:** 
- Established foundation for systematic development approach
- Created templates and strategies for maintaining project context
- Set up framework for decision tracking and architectural evolution

**Files Created:**
- `cloudmd` - Main project context file
- `subfolder-cloudmd-strategy.md` - Documentation strategy
- `change.log` - This decision tracking file

**Key Decisions Made:**
1. **Technology Stack:** Node.js/TypeScript with MCP SDK
   - **Why:** Official MCP support, strong typing, excellent async I/O
   - **Alternatives Considered:** Python, Rust, Go
   - **Trade-offs:** JavaScript ecosystem vs. performance (chose ecosystem maturity)

2. **Documentation Strategy:** Granular cloudmd files per module
   - **Why:** Reduces cognitive load, provides instant context
   - **Maintenance Cost:** Higher upfront, lower long-term cognitive cost
   - **Success Metrics:** Development velocity, context accuracy

3. **Security-First Architecture:** Security considerations from project start
   - **Why:** File system access requires paranoid security approach
   - **Impact:** All modules designed with security validation layers
   - **Implementation:** Path validation, authentication, authorization built-in

## Best Practices for Change Logging

### When to Log
- **Always Log:** Architecture decisions, security changes, breaking changes
- **Usually Log:** New features, significant refactoring, performance optimizations
- **Sometimes Log:** Bug fixes that reveal design issues, dependency updates with impact
- **Rarely Log:** Minor bug fixes, cosmetic changes, routine maintenance

### What to Include
1. **Context:** What was the situation before this change?
2. **Problem:** What issue were you trying to solve?
3. **Solution:** What approach did you take and why?
4. **Alternatives:** What other options were considered?
5. **Trade-offs:** What are the pros/cons of this decision?
6. **Future Impact:** How might this affect future development?

### Writing Guidelines
- **Be Specific:** Include exact details, not just general descriptions
- **Include Rationale:** Always explain the "why" behind decisions
- **Think Future:** Write for developers who will work on this in 6 months
- **Link Context:** Reference related files, issues, or documentation
- **Update Regularly:** Don't batch changes; log them as they happen

## Decision Review Process

### Monthly Reviews
- Review previous month's changes for patterns
- Identify decisions that didn't work out as expected
- Update architectural guidelines based on learnings
- Plan improvements for recurring issues

### Quarterly Assessments
- Evaluate major architectural decisions
- Assess impact of technology choices
- Review security implementation effectiveness
- Plan technical debt reduction

### Annual Architecture Reviews
- Complete system architecture assessment
- Technology stack evaluation and potential updates
- Long-term roadmap alignment with decisions
- Major refactoring or modernization planning

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Pre-Development
1. Review change.log for relevant context
2. Check for related previous decisions
3. Understand impact of planned changes

### During Development
1. Document significant decisions as they're made
2. Note unexpected challenges or discoveries
3. Record rationale for implementation choices

### Post-Development
1. Update change.log with final implementation details
2. Record lessons learned and future considerations
3. Update related documentation (cloudmd files)

### Code Review Process
1. Reviewer checks if significant changes are logged
2. Validate rationale makes sense in project context
3. Suggest improvements to decision documentation

## Maintenance and Evolution

### Change Log Health Metrics
- **Completeness:** Are all major decisions documented?
- **Clarity:** Can future developers understand the rationale?
- **Relevance:** Are old decisions still valid or need updating?
- **Accessibility:** Is the information easy to find and understand?

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and improve logging templates
- Gather feedback on documentation usefulness
- Evolve categories and guidelines based on project needs
- Integrate with other project documentation systems

**Log Maintenance:** This file should be updated immediately when significant changes are made, not batched or delayed. The goal is to capture decision-making context while it's fresh and complete.

**Review Schedule:** 
- Weekly: Check that recent changes are properly logged
- Monthly: Review decision patterns and update guidelines
- Quarterly: Assess overall decision quality and outcomes
