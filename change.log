- `plan.md` - Updated with final implementation phases
- Project scope expanded significantly

**Key Technology Decisions:**
1. **Multimodal Embeddings:** M-CLIP for text + image processing
   - **Why:** Research documents contain critical visual information often without captions
   - **Alternatives:** Text-only embeddings (insufficient for research needs)
   - **Trade-offs:** Higher complexity vs. comprehensive content access

2. **Agent Choice Search Strategy:** Separate MCP tools for different search modes
   - **Why:** AI agents understand query intent better than heuristic classification
   - **Implementation:** `search_text`, `search_semantic`, `search_multimodal` tools
   - **Benefits:** Flexibility, simplicity, performance optimization by agents

3. **Document Processing Stack:** LlamaIndex + Docling + Qdrant
   - **Why:** Leverage proven tools instead of building custom solutions
   - **LlamaIndex:** Orchestration and chunking expertise
   - **Docling:** Superior PDF parsing with image extraction
   - **Qdrant:** High-performance local vector database

4. **Three-Tier Permission System:** Context/Working/Output folder structure
   - **Why:** Matches research workflow patterns perfectly
   - **Context:** Read-only reference materials (funding docs, policies)
   - **Working:** Editable proposal sections and drafts
   - **Output:** Agent-controlled creation with subfolder rights

5. **Local-First Architecture:** No cloud dependencies for core functionality
   - **Why:** Research data privacy, performance, reliability, cost control
   - **Implementation:** Local Qdrant, local M-CLIP, local file processing
   - **Future:** Can add cloud deployment options later

**UI/UX Decisions:**
1. **Dual View System:** File explorer + filtered list views
   - **File Explorer:** Folder tree with drag-and-drop permission assignment
   - **List View:** Advanced filtering by permissions, type, date, size
   - **Why:** Supports both hierarchical organization and flat searching

2. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket integration for live file system changes
   - **Why:** Multiple agents and users may modify files simultaneously
   - **Implementation:** chokidar file monitoring + WebSocket broadcasting

**Search Architecture Decisions:**
1. **FlexSearch:** Fast keyword/phrase matching with multilingual support
2. **M-CLIP Semantic:** Conceptual queries using text embeddings
3. **M-CLIP Cross-Modal:** Text→image and image→text search capabilities
4. **Agent Selection:** No automatic routing - agents choose appropriate tool

**Migration Notes:**
- Previous generic file server concepts completely replaced
- All documentation updated to reflect multimodal research focus
- Technology stack expanded significantly (M-CLIP, Docling, LlamaIndex, Qdrant)

**Rollback Plan:**
- Can simplify to text-only version by removing M-CLIP image processing
- Can reduce to basic file server by removing search capabilities
- Modular architecture supports incremental rollback

### [UI/UX] Permission System Redesign & Visual Indicator Implementation
**Type:** Feature + Bug Fix + UI/UX  
**Change:** Complete redesign of permission management interface and resolution of backend-frontend permission type inconsistencies  

**Rationale:** 
- User requested removal of non-functional drag & drop assignment areas and redundant modal dialogs
- Need for clear visual indicators showing current permission status for files and folders
- Critical bug where permission indicators showed gray dots instead of correct colors due to type mismatches
- Backend was returning 'read-only'/'read-write'/'agent-controlled' while frontend expected 'context'/'working'/'output'

**Impact:**
- **UI Significantly Cleaner**: Removed redundant "Manage Permissions" modal and non-functional drag & drop zones
- **Visual Clarity**: Permission dots now correctly display Blue (context), Green (working), Purple (output)
- **Left-positioned Indicators**: Permission dots appear before folder/file icons for immediate visibility
- **Backend-Frontend Consistency**: All permission types now use unified 'context'/'working'/'output' naming
- **Real-time Accuracy**: Permission changes in Configuration tab immediately reflect in File Explorer

**Files Affected:**
- `frontend/src/components/FileExplorer.tsx` - Removed redundant UI elements, added permission dots
- `backend/files/permissions.ts` - Fixed permission type returns and async import compatibility
- `backend/types/index.ts` - Updated FilePermission type definition
- `backend/server/web-server.ts` - Fixed async permission calls in API endpoints
- `README.md` - Updated with correct server ports and current implementation status
- `plan.md` - Marked Phase 1 as complete with detailed achievements

**Key Technical Fixes:**

1. **Permission Type Consistency**
   - **Before**: Backend returned 'read-only', frontend expected 'context'
   - **After**: Unified 'context'/'working'/'output' naming throughout codebase
   - **Files**: `permissions.ts`, `types/index.ts`, all related modules

2. **Async Import Bug Resolution**
   - **Problem**: ES module context `require('path')` caused "require is not defined" errors
   - **Solution**: Replaced with `await import('path')` and made functions async
   - **Impact**: Fixed critical permission checking failures in `/api/filesystem/browse` endpoint

3. **UI Component Cleanup**
   - **Removed**: Non-functional drag & drop zones for permission assignment
   - **Removed**: Redundant "Manage Permissions" button and modal dialog
   - **Added**: Inline permission indicator dots positioned leftmost before file icons
   - **Enhanced**: Real-time WebSocket synchronization between Configuration and File Explorer

**API Endpoint Fixes:**
- **Before**: `/api/filesystem/browse` returned `"permissions":null` due to async import errors
- **After**: Correctly returns `"permissions":"context"` for configured folders
- **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive permission matching traces for troubleshooting

**User Experience Improvements:**
- **Permission Assignment**: Clean Configuration tab with drag-and-drop folder management
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate color-coded permission status for all files/folders
- **Interface Clarity**: Removed confusing UI elements, focused on essential functionality
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes in Configuration instantly visible in File Explorer

**Testing Validated:**
- ✅ Contacts folder correctly shows blue dot (context permission)
- ✅ Configuration changes immediately sync to File Explorer
- ✅ WebSocket connections stable between frontend and backend
- ✅ All permission types display correct colors and positioning
- ✅ Backend API returns consistent permission naming

**Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Permission Indicator Positioning**: Left-side placement for immediate visual scanning
   - **Why**: Users scan left-to-right, permission status should be first visual element
   - **Implementation**: CSS flexbox with permission dot as first child element

2. **Color Coding Strategy**: Intuitive color association for permission types
   - **Context (Blue)**: Information/reference association
   - **Working (Green)**: Active/editable status
   - **Output (Purple)**: Special/agent-controlled designation

3. **Real-time Synchronization**: WebSocket-based updates for configuration changes
   - **Why**: Multiple tabs/users may modify permissions simultaneously
   - **Implementation**: Broadcast permission updates via WebSocket to all connected clients

**Performance Impact:**
- **Positive**: Removed unnecessary React components and modal rendering
- **Positive**: Async imports resolve faster than synchronous requires in ES modules
- **Neutral**: Permission dot rendering adds minimal overhead
- **Positive**: Eliminated redundant API calls from removed UI components

**Security Considerations:**
- **Enhanced**: Improved path validation through async import compatibility
- **Maintained**: All existing permission validation and sandboxing
- **Improved**: Better error handling and logging for security audit trails

**Migration Notes:**
- **Breaking Change**: Permission API responses now use 'context'/'working'/'output' instead of old names
- **UI Changes**: Removed drag & drop zones and "Manage Permissions" modal
- **Configuration**: Existing user-settings.json files remain compatible
- **Backward Compatibility**: MCP tools continue to work with updated permission types

**Future Considerations:**
- Permission dots could be made configurable (position, colors, visibility)
- Additional permission types could be easily added with current architecture
- UI framework supports future enhancements without major refactoring

**Rollback Plan:**
- Revert `FilePermission` type to old values if MCP integration issues arise
- Restore modal dialogs if users request more detailed permission management
- Can temporarily disable permission dots while maintaining functionality

**Phase 1 Completion Assessment:**
This change represents the completion of Phase 1 objectives:
- ✅ Clean, functional file permission management interface
- ✅ Real-time synchronization between configuration and file explorer
- ✅ Complete three-tier permission system working end-to-end
- ✅ Solid foundation for Phase 2 multimodal features

**Developer Experience Improvements:**
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive console logging for permission matching
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage with no type mismatches
- **Code Quality**: Eliminated redundant components and improved maintainability
- **Documentation**: Updated README, plan, and change log with current status
